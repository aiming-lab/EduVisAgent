  - Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts (task analysis), and providing specific guidance for each step.
  - For example: first identify the problem type (e.g., flow rate problem), then convert it into a diagram or equation, and finally solve and verify.
  - Introduce the mnemonic strategy **F.O.P.S (Find, Organize, Plan, Solve)**:
    - **F** â€“ Find problem type
    - **O** â€“ Organize using diagram or equation
    - **P** â€“ Plan to solve
    - **S** â€“ Solve problem
